# Sprint 1: TypeScript CSV

### Task C: Proposing Enhancement

- #### Step 1: Brainstorm on your own.

In my opinion, our current parser is far from perfect, and we will need a lot of changes to make it a good product. Here are some of my propositions:
 1) A CSV parser needs to not separate commas that are inside of the double quotes, and also if two or more double quotes are in a row, it should treat them as one (Mainly functionality)
 2) A CSV parser needs to be able to handle different kinds of data, converting the results as the user requests (Both functionality and extencibility)
 3) A CSV parser should be able to deal with uneven rows, either throwing an error or maybe filling smaller rows with empty objects.
 4) A CSV parser needs to be able to account presence/absense of the header line, performing separate actions according to it's status.
 5) A CSV parser 
 6) A CSV parser

- #### Step 2: Use an LLM to help expand your perspective.
By using copilot, I learned about some more niche cases like:
1) A parser should be supporting different encodings of the symbols. (Extensibility for users who might not have standart one.)
2) (Maybe) A parser should 


- #### Step 3: use an LLM to help expand your perspective.

    Include a list of the top 4 enhancements or edge cases you think are most valuable to explore in the next week’s sprint. Label them clearly by category (extensibility vs. functionality), and include whether they came from you, the LLM, or both. Describe these using the User Story format—see below for a definition. 

    Include your notes from above: what were your initial ideas, what did the LLM suggest, and how did the results differ by prompt? What resonated with you, and what didn’t? (3-5 sentences.) 

In my opition the top 4 enhancements are:
